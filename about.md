## About

The **Write Code Every Day** is a movement to pass and propagate the idea of daily useful code. The challenge is based on certain rules, which are described in [John Resig's article](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/).

But basically is to write useful code every day and take it as a challenge. The repository only helps you to further strengthen this personal commitment.
